# AI Librarian Agent

The Bayit+ Librarian Agent is an AI-powered assistant that automates content auditing, classification, and metadata enrichment. It continuously monitors your library to maintain quality and consistency.

## Librarian Capabilities

The AI Librarian performs several automated tasks:

- **Content Classification**: Automatically assigns genres and categories based on content analysis
- **Metadata Validation**: Identifies missing or inconsistent metadata fields
- **Age Rating Verification**: Reviews content against rating criteria
- **Duplicate Detection**: Finds potential duplicate entries in your library
- **Quality Audits**: Flags content with technical issues

## Accessing Librarian Reports

View Librarian activity from **Content** > **Librarian Reports**:

| Report Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Classification Suggestions | Proposed category changes |
| Metadata Issues | Missing or invalid fields |
| Rating Concerns | Content flagged for rating review |
| Quality Alerts | Technical problems detected |

## Reviewing Suggestions

The Librarian presents suggestions for human review:

1. Navigate to the pending suggestions queue
2. Review the AI's analysis and reasoning
3. Accept, modify, or reject each suggestion
4. Accepted changes apply immediately

The Librarian learns from your decisions to improve future suggestions.
