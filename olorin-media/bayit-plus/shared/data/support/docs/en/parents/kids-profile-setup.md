# Kids Profile Setup

Creating dedicated kids profiles ensures your children see only age-appropriate content tailored to their interests. Each profile has its own watchlist, viewing history, and personalized recommendations.

## Creating a Kids Profile

1. Open the Bayit+ app and go to **Profiles**
2. Select **Add Profile**
3. Enter your child's name and choose an avatar
4. Toggle **This is a kids profile** to enable
5. Select the appropriate age range
6. Save the profile

## Age Range Options

Kids profiles offer three age range settings:

- **Toddlers (0-4)**: Simple, gentle content with no conflict or scary elements
- **Young Children (5-7)**: Educational content with mild adventure themes
- **Older Children (8-12)**: More complex stories while avoiding mature themes

The age range determines which content appears in browse screens, search results, and recommendations.

## Customizing the Kids Experience

Each kids profile can be further personalized:

**Favorite Categories**: Select preferred content types like animation, educational, music, or nature documentaries.

**Language Preferences**: Choose audio and subtitle languages for multilingual households.

**Autoplay Settings**: Enable or disable automatic playback of the next episode.

## Kids Profile Interface

When a child selects their profile, they enter a simplified, colorful interface designed for easy navigation. This interface features:

- Large, easy-to-tap content tiles
- Voice search for younger children
- No access to account settings or billing
- Exit protection requiring parental PIN

## Managing Multiple Kids Profiles

You can create up to 5 kids profiles per account. Each profile maintains separate:

- Viewing history and progress
- Personalized recommendations
- Favorite content lists
- Watch time statistics for parents to review

Access kids profile analytics from **Settings** > **Parental Controls** > **Activity Reports**.
