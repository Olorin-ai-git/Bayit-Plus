# Safe Browsing Features

Bayit+ incorporates multiple layers of protection to ensure a safe viewing environment for your entire family. These features work automatically while allowing customization for your specific needs.

## Content Filtering

Our content filtering system operates at multiple levels:

**Automatic Filtering**: Kids profiles automatically filter out all content rated above the profile's age setting. This applies to browse screens, search results, and recommendations.

**Keyword Filtering**: Certain search terms are blocked on kids profiles to prevent accidental exposure to inappropriate content.

**Thumbnail Review**: All content thumbnails displayed on kids profiles are reviewed to ensure age-appropriateness.

## Search Safety

When using search on a kids profile:

- Results are limited to age-appropriate content only
- Autocomplete suggestions exclude mature titles
- Voice search includes the same safety filters
- Misspellings that might lead to inappropriate content are caught

## Recommendation Safety

Our recommendation engine for kids profiles:

- Only suggests content within the allowed rating range
- Excludes content with mature themes even if technically within rating limits
- Prioritizes educational and positive content
- Never recommends based on what adult profiles have watched

## Exiting Kids Mode

Kids profiles are protected from unauthorized exit:

1. Attempting to switch profiles requires the parental PIN
2. The home button returns to the kids profile home, not the main app
3. Settings access is completely disabled on kids profiles

## Reporting Inappropriate Content

If you encounter content you believe is incorrectly rated or inappropriate:

1. Navigate to the content details page
2. Select **Report Content**
3. Choose the reason for your report
4. Our moderation team reviews all reports within 24 hours

## Profile Lock

Enable profile lock to require PIN entry every time:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Parental Controls** > **Profile Lock**
2. Enable for non-kids profiles you want to protect
3. Anyone selecting a locked profile must enter the PIN

This prevents children from accidentally or intentionally accessing adult profiles.
