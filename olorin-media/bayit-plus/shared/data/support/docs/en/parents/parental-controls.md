# Parental Controls

Bayit+ provides comprehensive parental controls to help you manage what content your family can access. These tools give you peace of mind while your children enjoy age-appropriate entertainment.

## Setting Up Your PIN

A 4-digit PIN protects your parental control settings from unauthorized changes.

2. Select **Create PIN**
3. Enter a 4-digit PIN that your children won't easily guess
