Real-time AI translation & context for Israeli TV & Culture
```

**Description:**
```
Bring Israel Home. In Your Language.

Bayit+ is the world's first AI-powered streaming platform dedicated to Israeli and Jewish content. Whether you are an expat missing home, a partner trying to connect with the culture, or a student learning Hebrew, Bayit+ makes Israeli television accessible, understandable, and smarter than ever before.

Why Bayit+? Watching Israeli TV abroad has always been a challenge—language barriers, missing cultural context, and fragmented apps. Bayit+ solves this by adding an "Intelligence Layer" to your viewing experience. We don't just stream content; we translate and explain it in real-time.

✨ AI-POWERED FEATURES

🎙️ Real-Time AI Dubbing
Watch live Israeli news and entertainment in your native language. Our advanced AI dubbing technology translates the broadcast instantly, allowing you to listen to Channel 12, 13, and 14 in English, French, or Spanish with near-zero latency.

🧠 Smart Context Cards
Never feel lost again. When a politician, historical event, or slang term is mentioned on screen, Bayit+ pushes a "Context Card" to your device explaining exactly who or what it is. Understand the nuance, not just the words.

👁️ Visual Sync Technology
Already watching on your big screen? Use our "Magic Sync" feature. Simply point your camera at your TV, and Bayit+ will identify the show and sync the translated audio to your personal device—perfect for mixed families where one person speaks Hebrew and the other doesn't.

📚 Interactive VOD Library
Explore a curated collection of Jewish and Israeli content enriched with AI deep-dives. Get AI-generated summaries, lesson plans for kids, and "Deep Dive" explainers that turn entertainment into a learning experience.
