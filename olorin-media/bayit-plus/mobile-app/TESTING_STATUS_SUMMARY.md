## Phase 1: Complete ✅

### App.tsx Fix (CRITICAL BLOCKER)

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**What Was Done**:
```tsx
// Before: Just a loading text screen
<View>
  <Text>Bayit+ Loading...</Text>
</View>

// After: Full app with providers
<SafeAreaProvider>
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <NavigationContainer>
      <AppContent />
    </NavigationContainer>
  </QueryClientProvider>
</SafeAreaProvider>
```

**Result**: App now launches in iOS Simulator with all navigation, voice support, and UI components functional.
