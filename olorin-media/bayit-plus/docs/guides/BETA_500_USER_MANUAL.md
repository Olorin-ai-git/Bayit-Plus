## Understanding AI Credits

### What Are AI Credits?

AI credits are the currency for using AI-powered features in Bayit+. Each AI operation (dubbing, search, recommendations) consumes a certain number of credits based on usage.

### Your Credit Allocation

- **Initial Credits**: 5,000 credits
- **Duration**: 90 days from verification
- **Renewal**: Not renewable (Beta 500 is a one-time program)

### Credit Consumption Rates

| Feature | Cost | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Live Dubbing** | 1 credit/second | 60 credits for 1 minute of dubbed audio |
| **AI Search** | 0.5 credits/query | 2 searches = 1 credit |
| **AI Recommendations** | 0.3 credits/request | ~3 recommendation requests = 1 credit |

**Example**: With 5,000 credits, you could:
- Watch **83+ minutes** of live-dubbed content, OR
- Perform **10,000** AI-powered searches, OR
- Get **16,000+** AI recommendations, OR
