Is payroll affected by Good Friday this week? Do I need to submit payroll any earlier than usual?,"Yes, Good Friday is a federal holiday and it will affect your payroll. If your payday is on Good Friday or the day after, you will need to send your payroll one business day earlier than usual. For QuickBooks Online Payroll Core, you need to send your payroll before 5:## PM PT # business day prior to payday with a 1-day lead time or 5:## PM PT # business days before payday. For QuickBooks Online Payroll Premium and Elite, you have same day direct deposit or a 5-day lead time. When you approve your paychecks before 7:## AM PT on the day before the holiday, your money will draw from your account the same day. Your employees will see the money by 5:## PM local time per NACHA rules. If you have a 5-day lead time, you'll need to give yourself an extra day. Instead of sending your payroll on the Friday before payday, you'll need to send payroll on the Thursday of the previous week.<p>Is this helpful?"
