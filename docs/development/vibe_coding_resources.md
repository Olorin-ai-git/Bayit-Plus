## 🔍 VAN Analysis Worksheets

### Level 1 Quick Analysis Template:
```markdown
# VAN Level 1 Analysis: [Problem]

## Problem Statement
[Clear, one-sentence description]

## VISUAL
- What does the current state look like?
- What should the end state look like?

## ANALYSIS  
- What's the core issue?
- What's the simplest solution?

## NETWORK
- What dependencies exist?
- What might break?

## Action Plan
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2] 
3. [Step 3]

## Implementation Notes
[Key decisions and rationale]
```

## 🤖 Cursor Prompt Library

### Authentication Patterns:
```
"Implement JWT authentication middleware that:
1. Validates tokens from Authorization header
2. Extracts user information from token payload
3. Creates user automatically if they don't exist
4. Handles token expiration gracefully
5. Returns appropriate error responses
6. Follows our existing error handling patterns"
```

### API Development:
```
"Create a REST API endpoint that:
1. Accepts [HTTP_METHOD] requests to [ENDPOINT_PATH]
2. Validates input using [MODEL_NAME] Pydantic model
3. Processes data using [SERVICE_FUNCTION]
4. Returns [RESPONSE_MODEL] with appropriate status code
5. Includes comprehensive error handling
6. Adds appropriate logging and monitoring"
```
