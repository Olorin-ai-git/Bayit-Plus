# Screen Time Management

Bayit+ includes built-in screen time controls to help you establish healthy viewing habits for your family. Set daily limits, schedule viewing windows, and receive alerts when limits are approaching.

## Setting Daily Time Limits

Configure maximum viewing time per day for each profile:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Parental Controls** > **Screen Time**
2. Select the profile to configure
3. Enable **Daily Time Limit**
4. Set the maximum hours and minutes
5. Enter your PIN to confirm

When the limit is reached, playback pauses and a friendly message appears explaining that viewing time has ended for the day.

## Creating Viewing Schedules

Restrict viewing to specific time windows:

1. Navigate to **Screen Time** > **Viewing Schedule**
2. Select days of the week to configure
3. Set allowed viewing hours (for example, 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM)
4. Save your schedule

Outside scheduled hours, the profile displays a message indicating when viewing will be available again.

## Bedtime Mode

Automatically stop playback at a designated bedtime:

1. Enable **Bedtime Mode** in Screen Time settings
2. Set the bedtime for each day
3. Choose a wind-down period (5, 10, or 15 minutes)

During wind-down, a gentle reminder appears. At bedtime, the current episode finishes and no new content can start.

## Screen Time Reports

Review viewing habits through detailed reports:

- **Daily summaries**: Time watched per profile each day
- **Weekly trends**: Patterns in viewing behavior
- **Content breakdown**: Categories and titles watched most

Access reports from **Settings** > **Parental Controls** > **Activity Reports**.

## Extending Time

For special occasions, you can grant temporary extensions:

1. When the time limit message appears, select **Request More Time**
2. A notification is sent to the parent account
3. Approve the request and enter your PIN
4. Choose the extension duration (15, 30, or 60 minutes)
