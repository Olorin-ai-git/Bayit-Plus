## Content Descriptors

Beyond the main rating, descriptors provide specific guidance:

- **V**: Violence or fantasy violence
- **S**: Sexual content or suggestive dialogue
- **L**: Coarse or crude language
- **D**: Suggestive dialogue
- **FV**: Fantasy violence (children's programming)

These descriptors appear below the rating on content details pages.

## How Ratings Are Assigned

Our content team reviews all material using established guidelines from rating boards including the MPAA and TV Parental Guidelines. Factors considered include:

- Intensity and frequency of violence
- Language and dialogue content
- Thematic elements and mature subjects
- Depictions of substance use

## Using Ratings with Parental Controls

Ratings integrate directly with parental controls:

1. Set a maximum rating for each profile
2. Content above that rating is automatically hidden
3. Attempting to access restricted content requires your PIN

## Regional Rating Differences

Some content may have different ratings in different regions. Bayit+ displays the rating appropriate for your location. If you travel, ratings may adjust based on local standards.
