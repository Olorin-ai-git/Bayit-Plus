# Content Flows

Flows are curated playlists and thematic collections designed to enhance your viewing experience. Our editorial team creates flows around themes, moods, events, and trending topics.

## What Are Flows

Flows combine related content into cohesive viewing journeys. Rather than selecting individual titles, you can immerse yourself in a flow and let the content play continuously.

Examples of flows include:
- Classic Cinema Sundays
- True Crime Binge
- Feel-Good Comedies
- Award-Winning Documentaries
- Seasonal Holiday Specials
