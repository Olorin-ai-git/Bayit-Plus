# Watchlist and Favorites

Keep track of content you want to watch and organize your favorite shows, movies, and channels for quick access.

## Watchlist

Your watchlist is a personal queue of content you plan to watch. Add items to remember them for later viewing.

### Adding to Watchlist

1. Navigate to any movie, TV show, or live channel
2. Select the content to view its details page
3. Tap the "Add to Watchlist" button (bookmark icon)
4. The item is saved to your personal watchlist

### Accessing Your Watchlist

Find your watchlist in the "My Library" section of the app. Content is displayed with:
- Title and thumbnail
- Type (movie, series, channel)
- Progress indicator for partially watched content
- Date added

### Organizing Your Watchlist

- Sort by date added, title, or content type
- Filter by movies, series, or channels
- Remove items you no longer want to track

### Watchlist Sync

Your watchlist syncs across all devices. Add something on your phone and access it on your TV.

## Favorites

Mark content as a favorite for instant access. Favorites differ from watchlist by providing a permanent collection rather than a temporary queue.

### Adding Favorites

1. Open any content, channel, or podcast
2. Tap the heart icon to mark as favorite
3. Access all favorites from the Favorites section

### Types of Favorites

- **Shows**: Favorite series appear first in recommendations
- **Channels**: Favorite live channels show at the top of your channel list
- **Podcasts**: Favorite podcasts are prominently displayed in the Podcasts section
- **Radio Stations**: Quick access to preferred stations

## Profile-Specific Lists

Each user profile maintains separate watchlist and favorites. Family members can personalize their own collections without affecting others.

## Smart Recommendations

Bayit+ uses your favorites and watchlist activity to improve content recommendations, helping you discover new shows and movies aligned with your interests.
