2. **Restart playback** - Close and reopen the video
3. **Update the app** - Ensure you have the latest version
4. **Clear app cache** - Remove cached subtitle data

### Verifying Subtitle Availability

## Wrong Subtitle Language

### Changing Subtitle Language

### Language Not Available

If your language is not listed:

## Subtitle Sync Issues

### Subtitles Ahead or Behind

If subtitles do not match the dialogue:

1. **Restart playback** - Often resolves temporary sync issues
2. **Seek backward** - Jump back 10-15 seconds
3. **Try different quality** - Lower quality may help

If your device supports subtitle delay adjustment:
1. Access playback settings
2. Find **Subtitle Sync** or **Subtitle Delay**
3. Adjust timing in milliseconds

5. Negative values advance subtitles

### Persistent Sync Problems

If sync issues affect only specific content:
