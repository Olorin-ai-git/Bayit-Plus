# Network Requirements

Ensure your internet connection meets the requirements for optimal Bayit+ streaming performance.

## Internet Speed Requirements

### Minimum Speeds by Quality

| Video Quality | Download Speed Required |
|---------------|------------------------|
| SD (480p) | 3 Mbps |
| HD (720p) | 5 Mbps |
| Full HD (1080p) | 10 Mbps |
| 4K Ultra HD | 25 Mbps |
| 4K with HDR | 40 Mbps |

### Testing Your Speed

1. Visit speedtest.net or fast.com
2. Run a speed test
3. Note your download speed
4. Compare against requirements
5. Test at different times of day

### Speed Recommendations

For best experience, we recommend:
- **Single viewer:** 1.5x the minimum speed
- **Multiple viewers:** Add requirements together
- **Example:** Two 4K streams need 50+ Mbps

## Wi-Fi Optimization

### Router Placement

1. Place router in central location
2. Elevate router off the floor
3. Keep away from walls and metal objects
4. Avoid placement near microwaves or cordless phones

### Wi-Fi Frequency Bands

| Band | Best For |
|------|----------|
| 2.4 GHz | Longer range, more interference |
| 5 GHz | Faster speeds, shorter range |

**Recommendation:** Use 5 GHz for streaming when possible.

### Reducing Interference

1. Change Wi-Fi channel in router settings
2. Update router firmware
3. Remove unused connected devices
4. Consider mesh Wi-Fi for large homes

### Wired Connection

For most stable streaming on TV:
1. Connect Ethernet cable to streaming device
2. Connect other end to router
3. Wired connections eliminate Wi-Fi issues
4. Recommended for 4K streaming

## Firewall Settings

### Required Ports

Bayit+ requires these ports to be open:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 80 | TCP | HTTP traffic |
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS traffic |
| 53 | UDP | DNS resolution |

### Configuring Your Firewall

1. Access router admin panel
2. Find firewall or security settings
3. Ensure above ports are not blocked
4. Add Bayit+ to allowed applications

### Enterprise Networks

For corporate or school networks:
1. Contact your IT administrator
2. Request access to streaming services
3. Provide required domain: *.bayitplus.com
4. May need proxy configuration

## VPN Issues

### VPN Compatibility

Using a VPN may cause issues:
- Reduced streaming speed
- Geo-restriction conflicts
- Connection drops during playback
- Some VPNs are blocked

### Recommended VPN Settings

If you must use a VPN:
1. Connect to server in your home country
2. Use a streaming-optimized server
3. Enable split tunneling for Bayit+
4. Use UDP protocol for better speed

### Disabling VPN for Streaming

For best experience:
1. Disable VPN when watching Bayit+
2. Or exclude Bayit+ from VPN tunnel
3. Check VPN provider for split tunneling

### VPN Blocked Error

If you see a VPN-related error:
1. Disconnect from VPN
2. Clear app cache
3. Restart the app
4. Try again without VPN

## Mobile Data Streaming

### Data Usage Estimates

| Quality | Data per Hour |
|---------|---------------|
| Low | 0.3 GB |
| Medium | 0.7 GB |
| High | 1.5 GB |
| Ultra | 3 GB |

### Reducing Mobile Data Usage

1. Go to **Settings** > **Playback**
2. Set **Mobile Data Quality** to Low or Medium
3. Enable **Wi-Fi Only** for downloads
4. Use downloaded content when possible

### Cellular Network Requirements

- 4G LTE recommended for HD streaming
- 5G provides best mobile experience
- 3G may only support SD quality
- Signal strength affects performance

## Network Troubleshooting

### Connection Drops During Playback

1. Check for Wi-Fi dead spots
2. Move closer to router
3. Restart router and device
4. Lower video quality setting
5. Try wired connection

### Buffering Problems

1. Run a speed test
2. Close other streaming apps
3. Disconnect unused devices
4. Lower quality in Settings > Playback
5. Restart network equipment

### Network Diagnostic

1. Go to **Settings** > **Help** > **Network Test**
2. Run the built-in diagnostic
3. Review results and recommendations
4. Follow suggested fixes

### DNS Issues

If content will not load:
1. Try changing DNS servers
2. Go to router settings
3. Set DNS to Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)
4. Restart devices after change

## ISP Considerations

### Throttling

Some ISPs throttle streaming traffic:
1. Run speed test to Bayit+ servers
2. Compare with general speed test
3. Contact ISP if significantly different
4. Consider ISP that does not throttle

### Data Caps

Be aware of data limits:
1. Check your ISP data cap
2. Monitor monthly usage
3. Lower quality to conserve data
4. Consider unlimited plans for heavy streaming

## Contact Support

For network-related help:
1. **In-App:** Settings > Help > Network Issue
2. Run network diagnostic before contacting
3. Include: ISP name, speed test results, router model
