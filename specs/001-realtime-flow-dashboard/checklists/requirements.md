# Specification Quality Checklist: Real-Time Flow Dashboard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-26  
**Feature**: `specs/001-realtime-flow-dashboard/spec.md`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

- Open items remaining:
  - Two [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (daily/monthly “source of truth”).
  - Once clarified, update FR-008/FR-009 and then re-check “Requirements are testable and unambiguous” and “All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria”.
