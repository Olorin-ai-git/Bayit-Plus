[STRICT REUSE][DIFF-ONLY]
Modify only the Product link component to use the existing slugify from olorin-front/packages/utils/strings.
- Keep routes unchanged (e.g., /product/:id stays).
- Build href as /product/${productId}-${slugify(productName)} (ID first, then slug).
- Do not create new helpers.
Return ONLY the diff between <PATCH> and </PATCH> markers.
Start each file with 'diff --git a/<path> b/<path>'.
[STRICT REUSE][DIFF-ONLY]
Modify ONLY: olorin-front/src/shared/components/ProductLink.tsx

Change:
- Replace the import of slugify from '../../packages/utils/strings'
  with a named import from '../../api/utils/string' (export is `export function slugify`).

Keep:
- Do NOT create new files.
- Do NOT change any routes.

Output:
Return ONLY a valid git unified diff between <PATCH> and </PATCH>, starting with "diff --git".
No prose, no code fences.
