## Rollback Plan

### When to Rollback

**IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK** (within 5 minutes):
- Error rate >20% increase
- Payment processing completely broken
- Authentication completely broken
- Homepage returns 500 errors
- Data corruption detected

**CONSIDER ROLLBACK** (within 15 minutes):
- Error rate 10-20% increase
- Key features broken (video player, search)
- Performance degradation >50%

**MONITOR BUT DON'T ROLLBACK**:
- Error rate <10% increase
- Minor UI glitches
- Non-critical features broken
- Low-traffic pages affected

### Rollback Procedure (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Execute rollback command (10 seconds)
firebase hosting:rollback

# 2. Verify rollback (2 minutes)
firebase hosting:releases:list
curl -I https://bayit-plus.web.app/

# 3. Monitor error rate (2-3 minutes)
# Check Sentry dashboard - error rate should decrease

# 4. Notify team (1 minute)
# Post in Slack/Discord
# Update stakeholders

# 5. Root cause analysis (post-rollback)
# Review logs
# Identify issue
# Plan fix
```

**Rollback Success Criteria**:
- Homepage returns 200 OK

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### Non-Blocking Issues

**Issue 1: TypeScript Warnings in Shared Components**
- **Impact**: None (runtime unaffected)
- **Count**: 45+ warnings
- **Location**: `../shared/` directory
- **Mitigation**: Web platform uses react-native-web aliasing which resolves at runtime
- **Priority**: LOW - Address in future sprint
- **Action**: Add proper type definitions for cross-platform components

**Issue 2: 76 Files Exceed 200-Line Limit**
- **Impact**: Maintainability concern (no runtime impact)
- **Largest File**: LibrarianAgentPage.tsx (893 lines)
- **Mitigation**: Recently migrated components (86) are all under 200 lines
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Schedule Phase 7 refactoring
- **Action**: Extract sub-components and hooks in next sprint

**Issue 3: No Automated Unit Tests**
- **Impact**: Testing coverage gap
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive manual testing performed by QA team
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Add in next sprint
- **Action**: Implement Jest + React Testing Library
