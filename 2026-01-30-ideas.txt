  AI Feature Enhancement Suggestions

  1. AI-Powered Content Summarization ("Catch Up")

  What: When a user tunes into a live broadcast mid-stream, offer an
  AI-generated "What you missed" summary using your existing Recap Agent.
  Currently the recap service exists but isn't deeply integrated into the
  viewing UX. Surface it as a one-tap overlay when joining a live channel late.

  Leverages: Recap Agent Service, Claude, existing transcript pipeline.

  ---
  2. AI Mood/Context-Based Channel Switching

  What: "I want something relaxing" or "Put on something for Shabbat dinner" -
  use natural language to auto-select the best live channel or VOD content based
   on current EPG data + cultural context. You already have the Cultural Context
   Service and LLM Search - this layers intent understanding on top.

  Leverages: Cultural Context Service, LLM Search, AI Recommendations, EPG data.

  ---
  3. Real-Time Sentiment Highlights

  What: During live broadcasts, detect emotionally significant moments (exciting
   sports plays, dramatic news, funny segments) from transcript sentiment
  analysis. Surface these as "highlight markers" users can jump back to. Creates
   a TikTok-like "best moments" reel from live TV.

  Leverages: Claude for sentiment analysis, existing STT transcript pipeline,
  spaCy NER.

  ---
  4. Cross-Content Knowledge Graph

  What: Connect trivia, search, and recommendations through a shared knowledge
  graph. When trivia detects a topic (e.g., a historical figure mentioned on
  Channel 12), link it to related VOD content, podcasts, and audiobooks.
  "Interested in what was just discussed? Here's a documentary and a podcast
  episode."

  Leverages: Live Trivia topic detection, Vector Search (Pinecone), AI
  Recommendations.

  ---
  5. Personalized Podcast Digests

  What: For users who follow Hebrew podcasts, generate a daily AI-curated audio
  digest - a 5-10 minute summary of key episodes across their subscriptions,
  synthesized with ElevenLabs TTS. Like a personalized "podcast newsletter" they
   can listen to during a commute.

  Leverages: ElevenLabs TTS, Claude summarization, podcast translation pipeline,
   speaker diarization.

  ---
  6. Interactive Voice Commands for Live TV

  What: "What song is playing?", "Who is being interviewed?", "Translate what
  they just said" - real-time voice queries processed against the live
  transcript. You have the STT, the transcript, and Claude. Wire them into a
  voice assistant overlay.

  Leverages: ElevenLabs STT, Claude, transcript buffer, Cultural Context
  Service.

  ---
  7. AI-Enhanced Parental Controls

  What: Real-time content classification using transcript + audio analysis.
  Instead of static channel ratings, dynamically detect and flag adult language,
   violent topics, or inappropriate content in real-time. Alert parents or
  auto-switch channels.

  Leverages: Claude content classification, existing STT pipeline, spaCy NER.

  ---
  8. Collaborative Viewing AI ("Watch Party Intelligence")

  What: When multiple users watch together (family/friends), blend their
  preference profiles for group recommendations. AI mediates between different
  tastes - "Dad likes news, kids want cartoons, here's a family documentary
  about Israeli nature."

  Leverages: AI Recommendations, user profile data, Claude reasoning.

  ---
  9. Multi-Language Live Chat Translation

  What: If you add live chat alongside channels, auto-translate chat messages in
   real-time so Hebrew, English, and Spanish speakers can all participate in the
   same conversation. Each user sees messages in their preferred language.

  Leverages: Google Translation API, existing translation pipeline, WebSocket
  infrastructure.

  ---
  10. AI-Powered Audio Description (Accessibility)

  What: Generate real-time audio descriptions of visual content for visually
  impaired users. Use scene detection + Claude to describe what's happening on
  screen, synthesized through ElevenLabs. This is both a strong accessibility
  feature and a differentiator.

  Leverages: Claude (with vision if processing frames), ElevenLabs TTS,
  WebSocket streaming.
