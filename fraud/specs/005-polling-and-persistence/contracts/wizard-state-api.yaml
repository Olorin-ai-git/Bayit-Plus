  title: Olorin Investigation Wizard State API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    REST API for managing investigation wizard state persistence, including state creation,
    retrieval, updates, and deletion. All endpoints require authentication via JWT token.

    **Key Features:**
    - Complete CRUD operations for wizard state
    - Optimistic locking with version control
    - Conflict detection and resolution
    - State validation and error handling
    - User-specific state isolation

    **State Lifecycle:**
    1. POST /wizard-state - Create initial state
    2. GET /wizard-state/{id} - Retrieve current state
    3. PUT /wizard-state/{id} - Update state (optimistic locking)
    4. DELETE /wizard-state/{id} - Delete state

    **Configuration:**
    All endpoint URLs, timeouts, and limits are read from environment variables.

      summary: Create new investigation wizard state
      description: |
        Creates a new wizard state record for an investigation. This endpoint is called when:
        - User starts a new investigation from settings page
        - User initiates investigation with template

        **Validation:**
        - investigation_id must be unique
        - wizard_step must be SETTINGS, PROGRESS, or RESULTS
        - settings_json validates against InvestigationSettings schema
        - user_id matches authenticated user

        **Idempotency:**
        If state with investigation_id already exists, returns 409 Conflict with existing state.

      summary: Retrieve investigation wizard state
      description: |
        Retrieves current wizard state for an investigation. Used by polling service to check state changes.

        **Polling Strategy:**
        - Fast interval (500ms): When status=IN_PROGRESS and wizard_step=PROGRESS
        - Normal interval (2s): When status=IN_PROGRESS and wizard_step=SETTINGS
        - Slow interval (5s): When status=COMPLETED or wizard_step=RESULTS

        **Access Control:**
        Users can only retrieve their own investigation states.

        **If-None-Match Support:**
        Returns 304 Not Modified if version matches, reducing bandwidth for polling.

      description: |
        Updates wizard state with optimistic locking. Used when:
        - User modifies settings
        - User navigates between wizard steps
        - Investigation progresses to next phase
        - Results are finalized

        **Optimistic Locking:**
        - Client must provide current version in request
        - Server verifies version matches current state
        - Returns 409 Conflict if versions don't match
        - Client must fetch latest state and retry

        **State Transitions:**
        Valid transitions:
        - SETTINGS → PROGRESS (when investigation starts)
        - PROGRESS → RESULTS (when investigation completes)
        - Any step → SETTINGS (reset/restart)

        **Validation:**
        - State transitions must be valid
        - JSON data must match step schema
        - Settings cannot be modified after PROGRESS step

      summary: Delete investigation wizard state
      description: |
        Permanently deletes wizard state. Used when:
        - User explicitly deletes an investigation
        - Investigation is archived or expired
        - Admin cleanup operations

        **Cascading Deletes:**
        - Associated audit log entries are retained (audit trail)
        - Results are moved to archive or deleted based on retention policy

        **Access Control:**
        - Users can only delete their own investigations
        - Admin users can delete any investigation

        **Soft Delete Option:**
        Use status=CANCELLED instead if audit trail must preserve full state.
